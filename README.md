# Bit Logic Calculator

Bit Logic Calculator is a program for analyzing, displaying and manipulating numbers at the bit level, providing bitwise logic operations, shifts and number system conversions, and is therefore indispensable, especially for hardware-related and system-oriented programming.

**Key Functions of a Bit Logic Calculator:**
- Representation of numbers in different number systems
  - Binary (Base-2)
  - Octal (Base-8)
  - Decimal (Base-10)
  - Hexadecimal (Base-16)
- Bitwise logical operations
  - AND (∧) – Combination of two bits
  - OR (∨) – Inclusive OR
  - XOR (⊕) – Exclusive OR
  - NOT (¬) – Bitwise inversion
- Bit shift operations
  - Left shift (<<) – Shift to the left (multiplication by 2ⁿ)
  - Right shift (>>) – Arithmetic shift
  - Logical right shift (>>> or SHR) – Logical shift without preserving the sign
- Bitmasks and flags
  - Setting, clearing, and checking individual bits
  - Visualization of flags (e.g., status or control bits)
- Display of the bit structure
  - Display of individual bits (e.g., 8-, 16-, 32-, or 64-bit)
  - Highlighting of set and unset bits
  - Support for signed and unsigned numbers

**Typical Applications:**
- Software development (low-level programming, C/C++, C#, Java)
- Embedded systems & microcontrollers
- Low-level programming (registers, protocols)
- Debugging of binary and hexadecimal values
- Data analysis in networks and file formats
